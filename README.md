# ARCADEwebsite
the second coming of the website for ARCADE Ottawa, a 24hr highschool hackathon! (That I quit the team of because I did everything... but this website will probably return & get slightly modified in December)
I decided to make another website for this hackathon because I could NOT decipher the code of the first website and needed to add a team section... so I made another website and made it prettier too! this time I decided to use tailwindcss because it makes styling website so much easier... and I actually make the code decipherable
### how i made the website
i used:
- HTML
- tailwindcss
- vanilla JS
- vite (build tool)
### what i struggled with/what i learned
- at first, i was using tailwind CLI as the build tool, and i was having the STRUGGLE OF MY LIFE because it would build my website super slowly. i was only using tailwind CLI because my vite setup wouldn't work, and at first it was alright, but as I added things to the website, it would build super slowly which is when i decided to bite the bullet and switch to vite.
- i realized my vite wouldn't work because I FORGOT to use npm init...
- lesson learned! use npm init before trying to install vite ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
- then, when i was shipping my code to github, the tailwind CSS wouldn't show up even though it worked when i ran it locally!
- turns out i used an outdated stylesheet link in my code AND forgot to put "root: /ARCADEwebsite/" in my vite.config.js ðŸ’€
- lesson learned! stop forgetting to add things ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
I worked pretty hard on this website, especially making it responsive! have fun looking at it :D
